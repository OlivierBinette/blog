Moving out of Montreal has provided me with the opportunity (it's more like a painful misery tbh) of reflecting back onto the five years I spent here. Much has happened in many aspects of my life, and on this blog I want to talk a bit about my time at UQAM.

Would I recommend a UQAM education to someone else? Certainly not. 

And I don't want to say that I didn't have great professors, colleagues and courses here. I'm very satisfied with how globally I have been educated and how I've grown. But I think I got a lot out of UQAM because I had to work to go beyond what was offered. I'm not sure everybody would have the commitment and passion to do that - and it has taken a toll on my passion and commitment.
