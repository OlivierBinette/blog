Moving out of Montreal has provided me with the opportunity (it's a bit painful to be honest) of reflecting back onto the five years I spent here. Much has happened in many aspects of my life, and on this blog I want to talk a bit about my time at UQAM.

Now, would I recommend a UQAM education to someone else? Certainly not.

I did have great professors, colleagues and courses here. I'm very satisfied with how globally I have been educated and how I've grown. But I think I got a lot out of UQAM because I had the time and the drive to go beyond what was offered. I'm not sure everybody would have the commitment and passion to do that - and it has taken a toll on me. 

Like in any other universities, most professors here are not available to meet and advise students. The worst was during my first year as an undergrad: professors would turn you away even during the scheduled office hours. In the second year I had learned my lesson and didn't try to show up to those anymore, and it's only in my third year and as a master student that I started getting in touch again. I've received great advice from some professors, notably my advisor, Jean-François Coeurjolly, Olivier Collin and François Bergeron, but only half of them are in statistics and none are in my field (my advisor does not have a field - it's a long story). I've seen many more burnouts and retirements than hires, and there are a few professors (even in our *small* deparment) that I've simply never seen at university. While we have a few great researchers, others don't do any research (and they're not any better teachers for it). Too many master students have had their student last more than 2 years (full-time!) and ended up not working in their field. And it's not even their fault - they were clever people - the problem was with the supervisors (yes, indeed those that don't do any research and don't have any industry contacts). It's a shame that it has happened, it's a shame that others in the department have let it happen, and it's ridiculous that it's going to keep on hapening.

So, do I recommand UQAM? If you know what you're doing, it will provide you access to standard scholarships, to the university library and *maybe* to an office. Jean-François Coeurjolly and Geneviève Lefebvre have done incredible work supporting research and students through the establishment of the group StatQAM, so you might get something out of this, and there is a handful of good supervisors. You can take most of your classes at McGill, UdeM or Concordia. 

But make sure you know what you're doing and that you have a plan which is independent from the support of anyone here.
