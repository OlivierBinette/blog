Moving out of Montreal has provided me with the opportunity of reflecting back onto the five years I spent here. Much has happened in many aspects of my life during this time and it's very painful to be leaving, but here I want to talk a bit about my time at UQAM.

So, would I recommend a UQAM education to someone else? Certainly not.

I did have great professors, colleagues and courses here. I'm very satisfied with how globally I have been educated and how I've grown. But I think I got a lot out of UQAM because I had the time and the drive to go beyond what was offered. I'm not sure everybody would have the commitment and passion to do that - and it has taken a toll on me. 

Like in any other universities, most professors here are not available to meet and advise students. The worst was during my first year as an undergrad: professors would turn you away even during the scheduled office hours. In the second year I had learned my lesson and didn't try to show up to those anymore, and it's only in my third year and as a master student that I started getting in touch again. I've received great advice from some professors, notably from my advisor, from Jean-François Coeurjolly, Olivier Collin and François Bergeron, but only half of them are in statistics and none are in my field (my advisor does not have a field - it's a long story). I've seen many more burnouts and retirements than hires, and there are a few professors (even in our *small* deparment) that I've simply never seen at university. While we have a few great researchers, others don't do any research (and they're not any better teachers for it). Too many master students have had their studies last more than 2 years (full-time!) and ended up not working in their field. And it's not even their fault - they were clever people - the problem was with the supervisors (yes, indeed, those that don't do any research and don't have any industry contacts). It's a shame that it has happened, it's a shame that others in the department have let it happen, and it's ridiculous that it's going to keep on hapening.

So, do I recommand UQAM? If you know what you're doing, it will provide you access to standard scholarships, to the university library and *maybe* to an office. Jean-François Coeurjolly and Geneviève Lefebvre have done incredible work supporting research and students through the establishment of the group [StatQAM](https://statqam.uqam.ca/), so you might get something out of this, and there is a handful of good supervisors (them included). You can take most of your classes at McGill, UdeM or Concordia. But make sure you know what you're doing and that you have a plan which is independent from the support of anyone here.
