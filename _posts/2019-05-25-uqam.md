I have attempted to write a small blog post yesterday about my experience in the statistics department at UQAM. That post - you can find it on my Github commit history if you really want - both praised some great people at UQAM and expressed a negative feeling that I have regarding our department. That negative feeling comes from how I think we too often fail in properly supporting students and in helping them achieve their full potential. I have personally been very lucky, but it's been quite a ride and certainly not everybody would strive in the kind of environment that I evolved in.

It's obviously a very delicate subject, but I feel a responsibility to be open about both the opportunities and the pitfalls that come with the imperfections of our department at UQAM. That's also in line with the philosophy of this notebook: it's a completely transparent window to some of my mathematical thoughts and feelings. However, my discussion of these issues, which are not criticisms beyond simply statements of fact, is not yet quite ready for public release. Too many aspects of the subject are too sensitive for me to post about on this blog, and hence I wouldn't be able to present a sufficiently detailed and nuanced account.
