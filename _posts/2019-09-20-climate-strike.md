I went to the "climate strike" in Raleigh this afternoon, an event which is part of [this week's protest]([https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/climate/global-climate-strike.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/climate/global-climate-strike.html?action=click&module=Top Stories&pgtype=Homepage)) of political inaction on climate change (or of denial of climate change). It was pretty small in Raleigh, but still interesting to hear from people with all kind of backgrounds and points of views. I also had the opportunity to write to North Carolina's governor Roy Cooper about this pressing issue. It's a rather personal letter, written quickly and without a deep knowledge of the topic. But I thought I'd share it here as it, I believe, carries common sentiments on this issue.

> I am temporarily visiting your country as a student at Duke University coming from Canada. I feel extremely privileged to have the opportunity to study at this institution. Some of my colleagues from Université du Québec à Montréal, coming from other parts of the world, would not have been able to enter this country. I thus feel the responsibility to make the most out of my time here, both learning from the rich intellectual culture at Duke and contributing through my research and involvement. Reaching out to you as a non-resident is part of this process.

> One of the most important issues we face today is human-caused climate change. Some of our best minds have studied this issue and developed solutions, and we know the least that has to be done: to implement environmental protection and resource preserving policies, while moving to a sustainable economy fuelled clean sources of energy. However, our researchers are being ignored or muted. We need politicians to acknowledge the problem and implement policy solutions.
